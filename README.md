                       Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal
                                 Virtue Mod
                        SimDing0 (SimDing0@hotmail.com)
                                 Version 19

Section I: Introduction
-----------------------
It all started in chat a while back, when Kish remarked that Reputation served
a dual purpose in the game. Not only does it indicate how other people in the game
think of the player, but also how morally "right" his actions are.

This mod sets out to remedy this by splitting it into two separate variables:
Reputation, which represents how people in the game feel about the party; and
Virtue, which represents how morally correct the party's actions are. Virtue will
now appear alongside reputation on the character screen, and be treated separately
where appropriate.

Additionally, Virtue will affect your alignment, so if your Virtue goes down, it
drags your alignment down with it. ALL party members also respond to Virtue instead
of reputation while in the party, although they continue to respond to reputation
while outside of it. They grow unhappy and leaving appropriately, so you can have a
party that feels your actions are good, even if everyone around you hates you.
Additional familiar dialog has been written to account for the impact of changing
alignment on your familiar.

Paladins will now fall after committing a TWO non-virtuous acts, and rangers will
now fall if their alignment shifts away from good.
You can get away with killing commoners without incurring a Reputation hit, so long
as nobody sees you. Your Virtue always drops, however.
Some of the things for which you would previously have incurred no penalty will now
affect your Virtue. This includes abandoning or killing NPCs and the trials you face
in Hell.


Section II: Installation
------------------------
BGII and ToB are required. The Virtue Mod should work fine with most other WeiDU
mods (including all of those created by the Pocket Plane team). It may be compatible
with some of the larger non-WeiDU mods, but I have not examined this possibility (and
have no real desire to).
THE VIRTUE MOD SHOULD BE INSTALLED *AFTER* OTHER WEIDU MODS.

Unzip the main ZIP file into your BGII main directory. This is normally:
        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\

Run (click on) "Setup-Virtue.exe".

First, pick your favorite language. Currently available:
  English
  French
  Spanish
  Polish (players are advised to read the translated readme, readme_polish.txt)
  Czech (players are advised to read the translated readme, readme_czech.txt)
  Italian
  Chinese

Then choose which components you would like to install. They are all optional. You may
always uninstall any or all of them later by re-running "Setup-Virtue.exe".

The Virtue mod may work correctly without starting a new game, but it is strongly
recommended that you do so.

The components should install correctly for international players who have both
DIALOG.TLK and DIALOGF.TLK.

Section IV: Known Issues
------------------------
Virtue will not be affected by pickpocketing. If anyone can thing of a good way
to get around this annoying engine limitation, please let me know!

NOTE: If, for some reason, an erroneous Virtue drop occurs that causes effects
such as undesired alignment shifting or loss of class, the effects of Virtue changes
can be deactivated by setting the GLOBAL "D0VirtueDisable" to 1 via the console.
Set it back to 0 to re-enable Virtue.
While Virtue is disabled, you can modify the GLOBAL "D0VIRTUE" to change your current
in-game Virtue.

For modders' information, Virtue copies a file "virtue.xxx" to the override, which
can be used by WeiDU installers to detect if the mod is installed. Don't use this
if you can help it though... you're probably better off talking to me about
compatibility.
